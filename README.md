# TigerGraph-Challenge_STEM-and-SDG-Opportunities-for-Women
Creating STEM Opportunities For Women and Enabling Search for UN SDG For Women.




OVERVIEW

This project resourcses is for the OneMilion Dollar TigerGraph Challenge. The project was carried out using the GraphStudio interface and the GSQL thereby obtained as expected. This project is a combination of Creating Global STEM Opportunities for Women and also Enabling effective and efficient Global UN SDG Search for Women.



BUSINESS CHALLENGES/PROBLEM STATEMENTS

1. Non-availability of a connected repository or database of all Female STEM graduates, Female STEM Practitioners and Female professionals globally, across all countries.
2. Non-availability of realtime glocal connected cost effective and mentoring newtork for STEM female graduates and professionals.
3. Inefficient and lack of connected STEM professinal and graduates to global opportunities across geographical regions.
4. Lack of efficient and effective connected informative database of SDG goals, opportunities and sub targets for Women across geograhical locations. 



CONCEPT

The brief conceptual methodology applied is to create a network of available data that influences STEM Women Opportunities and SDG Goals and target KPIs, influencing factors, socio demographic factors that can be accessed individually and also connected by geographical location (i.e Country name) and Date (year); which can then be used to effectively connect , inform and transform how opportunities are accessed globally and how insights from such data can be efficiently obtained to drive critical decisions and actions for the development of Women globally.



PROJECT SOLUTION

A.	Impactfulness :  This connected and available graph database of STEM Female Graduates Female STEM Practitioners and Female professionals globally, across all countries, will ensure that more opportunities are created and made available to Female STEM graduates without the restriction of distance. Furthermore, a lot of cost will be saved by making such information readily available in one shop and can connect Female STEM professional and graduates to opportunities and enable a more effective, efficient Mentoring network need to also boost the opportunities and development of Women in STEM. Also, with respect to similarly the SDG goals search for Women; this connected information of targets data across countries will enable a more robust ad efficient monitoring and follow ups on SDG programs for women and will definitely increase further strengthening of vital Women networks in relation to development and will increase GPD's of countries and build a better society quicker.

B.  Innovativeness : For this project; the major innovative approach applied was the combination of two topic areas, to achieve a robust use of the TigerGraph application. This further reveals that the tool can be employed for diverse research areas and carry out related analysis with a large amount of data and still obtain quality results. It goes further to suggest an efficient way of working, by ensuring that multiple separate systems are not necessarily created , but rather can be combined into one graph for an expansive database covering a variety of unstructured , sometime non related information set that can be analysed and then presented on a common structured platform.

C.	Ambitiousness : There is no doubt that a key driver for this project work is the extensive ambition of this project. Though limited by available and up to date data for certain factors and Countries; this work presented a combination of two key areas and goals that are at the heart of Women development globally. With about 30 Vertices and 50 plus edges; and a good number of important attributes, this work captured a variety of information that influences STEM opportunities and SDG availability and measurements for Women across all countries (where data is available ) of the world. The intent was to create an exhaustive centralized data store that captures data related to STEM, SDG Goals and sub targets for Women globally, with the aim of providing the key ingredient for analytics to derive opportunities and social economic advantages for Women globally. This is also to create a "ONE" network of STEM Women graduates and Professionals to engage in real time, effective and efficient collaboration, mentoring, recruitment, volunteerism, information and skills sharing sessions just by possible the simple click of a country search via for example, a mobile application, etc; which will thereby increase development opportunities for STEM Women and improve effective and efficient SDG searches for Women globally.

D. Applicability:  This work briefly demonstrated TigerGraph's excellent functionalities in handling a  diverse set of data from varied sources and of sizeable amount which typifies the modern day needs of our society in exploring big data which has the characteristics of Volume, velocity, variety, veracity and value. This work of course demonstrates some of these key elements needed in our society, as it can be accessed via a variety of tools like mobile applications, especially in rural areas where Women have just a mobile phone as a cheap means of communications. It presents the potential of a social network or “yellow pages” network of STEM Women and SDG opportunities for Women by the access to persons around the world having similar challenges, experiences and profile, and can provide solutions through an excellent network of important data and information from one platform. This will further influence Governments and organisations to scale up and speed up developments as they now can access vital KPIs and comparative real-time information on STEM data and SDG data for Women and ‘pin-point’ areas needing more urgent actions and prioritize development actions and save huge costs that comes with data acquisition and developmental planning. This can be further expanded and drive even more applicable value by integrating some personal information like email, company addresses to create efficient and effective, flexible, long term cost saving collaboration across geographies by this data store of a connected large set of important data and meta data needed to drive rapid development of STEM and Women economies and our World at large.



LIMITATIONS

1.  Lack of updated/consistent SDG and STEM regular data from all countries of the world.
2.  Unavaiability of measurement and monitoring STEM and SDG targets data from all countries of the World.
3.  Extra Skills on more diverse tools to demonstarte more real life application of this connected data network system.
